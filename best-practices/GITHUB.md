# Github Best Practices
## Git cheatsheet

This Git cheat sheet is a time saver when you forget a command or don't want to use help in the CLI.

Learning all available Git commands at once can be a daunting task. You can use "[Git Cheat Sheets](https://training.github.com/)" for a quick reference to frequently used commands. The "Using Git" cheat sheet is available in several languages.

In addition, take a look at our [Git and GitHub learning resources](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/git-and-github-learning-resources) page that links to guides, videos and more.  
  

## Repository best practices
[Create a README file](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/best-practices-for-repositories#create-a-readme-file)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To make it easier for people to understand and navigate your work, we recommend that you create a README file for every repository.

You can add a README file to a repository to communicate important information about your project. A README, along with a repository license, citation file, contribution guidelines, and a code of conduct, communicates expectations for your project and helps you manage contributions. For more information, see "[About READMEs](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/about-readmes)."

[Favor branching over forking](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/best-practices-for-repositories#favor-branching-over-forking)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To streamline collaboration, we recommend that regular collaborators work from a single repository, creating pull requests between branches instead of between repositories. Forking is best suited for accepting contributions from people that are unaffiliated with a project, such as open-source contributors.

To maintain quality of important branches, such as `main`, while using a branching workflow, you can use protected branches with required status checks and pull request reviews. For more information, see "[About protected branches](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/managing-protected-branches/about-protected-branches)."

[Use Git Large File Storage](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/best-practices-for-repositories#use-git-large-file-storage)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To optimize performance, GitHub.com limits the sizes of files allowed in repositories. For more information, see "[About large files on GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/managing-large-files/about-large-files-on-github)."

To track large files in a Git repository, we recommend using Git Large File Storage (Git LFS). For more information, see "[About Git Large File Storage](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/managing-large-files/about-git-large-file-storage)."
